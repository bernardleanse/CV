## Bernard Leanse

Always been drawn to engineering and problem solving! Been into tech and computers since a teenager.
Having started a degree in chemical engineering following top A level grades, studies were suspended following some challenges in my personal life. 

Became hooked on speciality coffee work and managed a top coffee place for a while. My personality is very all or nothing, when I decide i'm doing something,
I become obsessively meticulous with my approach unitl the job is done! 

I graduated from makers academy in December 2021, having learned so much! I think the most important skills taken away are teamworking, learning to embrace and accept frustration as part of the process, applying knowledge of concepts to new language/technology and learning while working on brand new projects.

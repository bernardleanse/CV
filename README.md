## Bernard Leanse

Always been drawn to engineering and problem solving! Been into tech and computers since a teenager.
Having started a degree in chemical engineering following top A level grades, studies were suspended following mental health difficulties. Decided I don't want to be stuck in a factory office in grangemouth. 

Became hooked on speciality coffee work and managed a top coffee place for a while. My personality is very all or nothing, when I decide i'm doing something,
I become obsessively meticulous with my approach unitl the job is done! Very keen on cycling and would love to work for a company such as komoot or Strava.

## Bernard Leanse

I graduated from makers academy in December 2021, having learned so much! The most important skills I took away were breaking down large problems into the smallest units possible, learning to embrace and accept frustration as part of the process, applying knowledge of concepts to new language/technology and learning while working on brand new projects. Pairing was one of my favourite things about the course because when you click and get into sync with your pair, you fly through problems and it's great fun. You don't always get this as everyone is different so I rose to the challenge of aiming to get to this level with whoever I paired with, which really helped to improve my people skills and empathy. 

I am now very keen to join a company where I can reinforce what I've learned at Makers and really learn how to do things in the best way possible!

Always been drawn to engineering and problem solving! Been into tech and computers since a teenager. 

I studied Chemical Engineering for two years and dropped out following personal difficulties.
 
Became hooked on speciality coffee work and managed a top coffee place for a while. My personality is very all or nothing, when I decide i'm doing something,
I become obsessively meticulous with my approach unitl the job is done!

## Work Experience

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

Always been a problem solver, people would always come to me if something wasn't working on their computer when I was growing up!
More recently I learned bike mechanics over lockdown and obviously faced many challenges but now competent building one from scratch!
In my management journey at lundenwic issues would come up all the time which forced me to think clearly and stay calm and carry on in the best way possible.

#### Team Working

Being in charge of a team of baristas was something that definately boosted my team working and communication skills.
What took them to the next level was makers academy where we did pair programming every day and it was invaluable in learning how to work with all sorts of different people who think differently and approach problems in different ways.

#### Empathy

I am a naturally empathetic person and I know how crucial this is a skill in the workplace, especially when giving feedback. I had to do this all the time when managing my independent coffee shop! Especially when you want things to be done a certain particular way, you've got to imagine being on the recieving end and make them not feel overly micro-managed!

## Education

#### Makers Academy (20/09/2021 to 10/12/2021)

Makers was fantastic as you are taught how to code in a self directed way, and you pair program every day which teaches you the vital communication skills you need to be a developer. I was taught how to follow a TDD process and to break down problems into small chunks.
